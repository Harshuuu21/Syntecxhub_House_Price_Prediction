# 🏠 House Price Prediction (California Housing Zone)

A complete, end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts median house prices in California based on features like median income, house age, and location.

This project demonstrates the standard ML pipeline: Data Loading, Feature Exploration, Model Training, Evaluation, and Deployment (Saving/Loading the model).

---

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the built-in **California Housing Dataset** provided by `scikit-learn`.

It contains **20,640 housing blocks** with 8 numerical features such as:

- `MedInc`
- `HouseAge`
- `AveRooms`
- `AveBedrms`
- `Population`
- `AveOccup`
- `Latitude`
- `Longitude`

> **Note:** The target variable (`Price`) is expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars (`$100,000`).

## 🛠️ Methodology

The project follows these 4 main steps:

### 1️⃣ Data Processing
- Load the California housing dataset
- Check for missing values
- Prepare features and target variables

### 2️⃣ Model Training
- Split the dataset into:
  - **80% Training Data**
  - **20% Testing Data**
- Train a `LinearRegression` model

### 3️⃣ Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared Score (R²)**

Also analyze feature importance using model coefficients.

### 4️⃣ Deployment
- Save the trained model using `joblib`
- Load the model later for predicting new house prices

## 📈 Results

After training the Linear Regression model, the following results are achieved on the test dataset:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| R² Score | ~0.575 |
| RMSE | ~0.745 |

### Interpretation
- The model explains approximately **57.5%** of the variance in house prices.
- The average prediction error is around **$74,500**.
